# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: This is actually around 2 weeks in to my coding journey, after putting it aside for awhile a couple years ago, however I'm starting the 100 days of code as of today. I'm currently working through Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML and CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) and while it is a tutorial I am actually building the website by hand along with the tutorial and pushing it to Github where it can be seen in it's current form at the link below. 

Things learned up to this point: 
1. Ubuntu Linux and the command line
2. Git and Github
3. Github pages
4. Sublime Text

I started working through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bflatt72)a couple years ago and got pretty far into Javascript before I hit a brick wall. I am determined to soldier on and to teach myself Web Development along with my programming classes at a local community college. 

**Thoughts:** I REALLY like Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML and CSS and am enjoying building out the Styles Conference website along with the tutorial. When I get done with it, I plan to branch it and re factor the website using Flexbox and another one with CSS grids and then again with Bootstrap.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
