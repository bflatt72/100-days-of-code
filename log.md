# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: This is actually around 2 weeks in to my coding journey, after putting it aside for awhile a couple years ago, however I'm starting the 100 days of code as of today. I'm currently working through Shay Howe's [Learn to Code HTML and CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) and while it is a tutorial I am actually building the website by hand along with the tutorial and pushing it to Github where it can be seen in it's current form at the link below. 

Things learned up to this point: 
1. Ubuntu Linux and the command line
2. Git and Github
3. Github pages
4. Sublime Text

I started working through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bflatt72)a couple years ago and got pretty far into Javascript before I hit a brick wall. I am determined to soldier on and to teach myself Web Development along with my programming classes at a local community college. 

**Thoughts:** I REALLY like Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML and CSS and am enjoying building out the Styles Conference website along with the tutorial. When I get done with it, I plan to branch it and re factor the website using Flexbox and another one with CSS grids and then again with Bootstrap.

### Day 1: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Last night I finished up Shay Howe's Learn HTML/CSS tutorial- Beginner. It took me a total of about a week working through it and building out the site as I went. I did it all by hand and did not use copy and paste except for large paragraphs and color codes. The website he has you build is very detailed which is good but I did not add every single speaker as there were over a dozen. I only added a few speakers and the entire schedule. 

This evening, after learning a little about Flexbox I decided I'd take the website I built with Shay Howe and change some of the layout to flexbox instead of inline-block and commenting out the spaces and using floats. I didn't do this to the entire site but I did it to the teaser section of main page and to the register page. Pretty cool. I did this after creating another branch called flex-box and I pushed that up to Github so that I now have two branches there, the master branch which is the original site built with Shay and the edited site I used Flexbox on. After learning some more Flexbox and then CSS Grid layouts I may edit it again using a Grid layout. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Styles Conference](https://bflatt72.github.io/projects/shayhowe/) this is the github page for the master branch. 

You can look at the code as follows:

1. [master branch](https://github.com/bflatt72/projects/tree/master/shayhowe)
2. [Flexbox branch](https://github.com/bflatt72/projects/tree/flex-box/shayhowe)

Over the last couple days I've also been working on teaching myself keyboard shortcuts for Sublime text editor and I installed some packages. 


<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday -->

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
